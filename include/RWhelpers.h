// remove_joinable_threads(): Remove all joinable threads from your thread list. See next slide for example using pthread_tryjoin_np.
// kill_and_join_all_threads(): Sends kill to all threads running and then calls pthread_join() on them.
// All your typical linked list functions. Single or double is fine, but double might make removing slightly easier in your remove_joinable_threads() function.
